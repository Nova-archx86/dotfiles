* Installation
At the time of writting this, my journey into NixOS and the Nix enviorment is still fairly new, so it is likely
this flake will be unstable and quite a mess and will probably change... **A LOT**. With that said the only
command ideally neaded to be run would be:

#+begin_src shell :tangle README.md
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --impure --flake .
#+end_src

While in the directory of the repo inside of an existing NixOS install.
